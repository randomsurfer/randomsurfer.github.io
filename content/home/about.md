# Hello!

I am presently working as a Senior Research Engineer at [NetraDyne](http://www.netradyne.com), where I am member of the Analytics Group. Iâ€™m primarily working in building machine learning models for processing sensory and visual information for commercial fleets and driver safety analytics.

Previously, I was working as a Data Scientist at Indix.com, where I was member of the [Machine Learning Group](https://www.indix.com/blog/engineering/building-comprehensive-database-products-open-problems-challenges-machine-learning/). At Indix, I was building predictive models for product categorization and for automatically extracting important product attributes from product pages and product titles.

I have a Master of Science by Research from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. 
I was advised by [Prof. B. Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). The topic of my research was graph mining, specifically my research thesis was on Scalable Role Identification and Discovery in Social Networks.
